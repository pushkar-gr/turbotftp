# TurboTFTP - High-Performance TFTP Client & Server

TurboTFTP is a lightweight and efficient Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) featured in C++ based on RFC 1350. It supports fast and reliable file transfers over UDP with RRQ (Read Request) and WRQ (Write Request) handling.
Features

- âœ” High-speed file transfers over UDP
- âœ” Supports file upload (WRQ) and download (RRQ)
- âœ” Implements 512-byte data packets with ACK handling
- âœ” Supports octet (binary) and netascii (text) modes
- âœ” Handles timeouts and retransmissions
- âœ” Lightweight and easy to integrate
